# Flappy Beat
My final project for 15-112 (Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science) at Carnegie Mellon University is a game where the player moves in the same manner as they would Flappy Bird and with the goal of dodging obstacles generated by a music visualizer. It features the ability to play against either an AI or in-person opponent for numerous song and visual selections (see bottom left). The music visualizer (see bottom right) was created using data from the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm with Aubio and NumPy.

## Running Code
The following libraries must first be installed:
- Pygame 
- Aubio
- Numpy 

To play the game, run Main.py. Ensure that all other .py files exist in the same main folder, all .wav files exist in the "songs" folder, and all .png files exist in the "images" folder.
